# RReminders
I've recently wanted to spend time practicing SwiftUI development with something non-trivial and decided to work on a reproduction of the 'Reminders' app for iOS.  As it turns out, this seemingly simple app has a lot of interesting ways of maintaining its data, making it a great case study.
